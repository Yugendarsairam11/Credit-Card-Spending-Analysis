3️⃣ Retrieve transaction details for each card type upon reaching a cumulative spend of 1,000,000.

4️⃣ Discover the city with the lowest percentage spent for gold card holders.

5️⃣ Generate a dynamic report showcasing city, highest_expense_type, and lowest_expense_type.

6️⃣ Uncover the percentage contribution of female spending across different expense types.

7️⃣ Find the card and expense type combination with the highest month-over-month growth in January 2014.

8️⃣ Identify the city with the highest spending-to-transaction ratio on weekends.

9️⃣ Explore the city that achieved its 500th transaction in the shortest time after the first.

✨ Personal Discovery: Through this personal project, I showcased my expertise in SQL data analysis and my knack for uncovering insights from complex datasets. It was more than a project; it was a journey of personal growth and discovery.
